<p>Assignment: <em>Design a game around a cause you are passionate about</em>. <a href="https://github.com/giocare">Jessica Adjei</a> and myself developed a narrative around vaccination; we included statistics as a form of education and a game of chance as a realization of those statistics with a game conclusion outside of the control of the player -- the player can only improve their odds by taking control of the immune system to defeat the antigens.</p>
